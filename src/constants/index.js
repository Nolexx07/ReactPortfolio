Hi! I‚Äôm Malkam Sathvik, an enthusiastic Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) student at TKR College of Engineering and Technology üéì, passionate about developing innovative tech solutions üí°. I have worked on impactful projects such as Red Prime ü©∏, a life-saving blood donation app with real-time donor-recipient connections; Placement Prep Solution (PPS) üéØ, a responsive platform simplifying placement preparation; and Instacopy üîç, a browser extension prototype for extracting and managing text, inspired by Google Lens.

With experience from internships in AI ü§ñ, Java Development ‚òï, and Web Development üåê, I‚Äôve built projects like a rule-based chatbot, a library management system, and dynamic websites. Currently, I‚Äôm mastering the MERN stack üíª and exploring generative AI tools like Synthesia and Lumen5 üõ†Ô∏è to broaden my skill set. My goal is to excel as a Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET) üöÄ, focusing on Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) üìö to achieve this ambition. I strive to create impactful solutions that address real-world challenges üåü and leave a lasting impression.`;
